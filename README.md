play21-app-modularization
=========================

An investigation into breaking a Play 2.1 app into modules.  Basic modules to include: 

* common model
* tags
* layouts
* web app

Given Play's very slow rebuild time with larger (all-in-one) projects, this investigation should provide the average user a template for setting up their project to avoid the problem entirely.
